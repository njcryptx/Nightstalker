NightStalker Installer

This repository contains a script to set up the NightStalker tool, a C++ program designed for specific system utilities and network operations. The script automates the installation of necessary dependencies, compiles the nightstalker program from source, and installs it into a system-wide directory.

Features

Dependency Check: Verifies if required commands are installed and installs missing dependencies.

Automated Installation: Supports multiple package managers (e.g., apt, yum, pacman, pkg) for installing packages.

Compilation: Compiles the nightstalker C++ source file.

Environment Compatibility: Supports Linux and Termux environments.


Prerequisites

g++: To compile the C++ source file.

Python: To run the script.

Root/Sudo Permissions: Required to install system packages and move the compiled binary.


Installation

Clone this repository and navigate to the project folder:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nightstalker-installer.git
cd nightstalker-installer

Run the setup script:

python setup.py

How It Works

1. Checks Commands: The script verifies if necessary commands like clang, curl, and tor are installed.


2. Installs Missing Packages: If any required package is missing, the script installs it using the appropriate package manager.


3. Installs Python Dependencies: Installs Python packages like torspy if pip is available.


4. Compiles NightStalker: Compiles the nightstalker.cpp file into an executable binary.


5. Places Binary in System Path: Moves the compiled binary to a system-wide location (e.g., /usr/bin or Termuxâ€™s /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin).



Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can use the nightstalker command directly from your terminal. For example:

nightstalker [options]

Customizing the Installation Path

The script defaults to installing the binary in /usr/bin or Termux's /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin. Modify the destination variable in setup.py if you prefer a different path.

Troubleshooting

Unsupported System: The script currently supports only Linux-based systems with common package managers (apt, yum, dnf, pacman, etc.).

Permission Errors: Ensure you run the script with root or sudo privileges.
